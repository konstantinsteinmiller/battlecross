// ─── History mode ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// MEMORY history on the Playgama build, hash history everywhere else.
//
// That archive is also the YouTube Playables submission, and Playables serves
// the game from a URL whose shape is not ours — something like
// `e2e.playables.usercontent.goog/<id>/…`. A history mode that READS the
// address bar to decide the initial route is therefore reading someone else's
// URL: it can resolve to a route that does not exist and render nothing, with
// the SDK contract fully satisfied. That is not hypothetical — it is how a
// 2026-09 submission failed while every MUST and SHOULD in YouTube's own test
// suite passed, which is the worst possible failure shape because no automated
// check reports it.
//
// Memory history never touches the address bar at all: the initial route is
// always `/`, which is what this app wants anyway — nothing that ships calls
// `useRouter`, `useRoute` or `router.push`, and there is not a single
// `<RouterLink>`. The router exists to mount one component and to keep the
// dev-only bench reachable.
//
// Which is also why hash history is KEPT elsewhere: the dev bench at
// `/models` is navigated to by typing a URL, and memory history would make it
// unreachable in dev. The other
// portals are shipping and working on hash history, so they are left alone —
// this is a fix for a measured Playables failure, not a blanket change.
