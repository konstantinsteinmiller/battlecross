//
// Field names INSIDE the single `mega_droid_state` blob (see
// `useGameState.ts`). These are NOT separate localStorage keys — they are
// properties of the one persisted object — but they are still a contract with
// the player base: renaming any of them strands existing players' progress on
// the old field. Treat them as load-bearing constants.
//
// Everything is `ma_`-prefixed (`STATE_FIELD_PREFIX`) so
// `SaveMergePolicy.isPayloadKey` can allowlist the whole surface with a single
// prefix.

// ─── Headline progress (flat numbers the save-merge score reads) ───────────
//
// Kept as flat numeric fields rather than buried inside `ma_hero` because the
// save layer scores two snapshots against each other WITHOUT knowing anything
// about the game's object shapes (`SaveMergePolicy.computeMeta`), and a portal
// plugin (GamePix) reports two of them as score/level.
