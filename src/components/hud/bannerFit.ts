/**
 * ─── Sizing the big moment banner ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * "GAME OVER!" is ten characters in English and nineteen in Indonesian, and a
 * phone held upright is a seventh as wide as an ultrawide monitor. The banner
 * must still read on ONE line everywhere, so its font size is computed, not
 * picked: the text is measured once at a reference size in the real font, and
 * since every metric that sets its width (glyph advances, em-based tracking)
 * scales linearly with the font size, one division gives the size that fills
 * the free width. The band that carries the text is capped on height as well,
 * so a landscape phone keeps most of its game view.
 *
 * No DOM here, so the tests can check the arithmetic itself.
