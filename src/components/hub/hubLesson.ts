/**
 * ─── The upgrade tour (the Workshop's first visit) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The Workshop is full of rows, prices and stats — too much to take in at
 * once. So the first time the player comes home with the Workshop open (it
 * unlocks after two finished missions, `hubUnlocks.ts`), a guide walks them
 * through the one loop that matters: bolts in, gear up. It never runs while
 * the Workshop is locked.
 *
 *   workshop       → tap the Workshop tab
 *   upgradeBuster  → upgrade the buster (weapon: damage)
 *   pickArmor      → select the chest armour (defence)
 *   upgradeArmor   → upgrade it
 *   deploy         → back to Missions
 *
 * Wordless: a hand (a cursor on desktop) is on the target from each step's
 * first frame and taps; everything else is dimmed and inert, but a press
 * there makes the live target pulse, so the tour never reads as a lock-up
 * (`HubLesson.vue`). Each step ends on the game's own state (the tab open,
 * the level up), never on a timer. It runs once per profile
 * (`tips['lesson:upgrade']`); a player who has already upgraded something
 * skips it, and a close button ends it any time.
