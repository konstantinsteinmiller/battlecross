/**
 * ─── Boot priming ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Called by the LOADER (`useAssets.preloadAssets`) while the splash is up:
 * loads the profile, creates the renderer, bakes the shared canvas textures,
 * builds the FIRST scene (a resumed mission, the tutorial, or the hub — never
 * a menu) and compiles its shaders. By the time the splash clears, the first
 * frame is ready to draw.
 *
 * Three rules, each one a measured failure before it was a rule:
 * - The loader PAINTS FIRST. Nothing heavy starts until the splash has been
 *   on screen for a frame, so the player gets feedback before the work.
 * - The build is time-sliced (`Mission.create`), so the bar keeps moving.
 * - The scene NEVER builds its own copy. `GameScene` waits on `adoptBootMode`
 *   for the prepared mode. It used to fall back to a fresh synchronous build
 *   whenever it mounted before priming finished — which it always did — so
 *   the first sector was built TWICE, the second copy without the shader
 *   precompile, and the loader froze through both.

 * Compile a scene's shader programs off the critical frame. `compileAsync`

 * cache key of EVERY material and assembles every new program's source, all
 * synchronously — one ~500-800 ms task on a throttled CPU. So programs are
 * created one material at a time (sliced; the GPU still compiles them in
 * parallel), and readiness is polled directly rather than through a final
 * `compileAsync`, which would re-derive everything in one task again.
