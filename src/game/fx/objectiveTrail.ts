/**
 * ─── Objective trail ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Small yellow chevrons on the floor that lead to the mission's main
 * objective (`MissionObjects.target`) — in the tutorial walkthrough to its
 * next lesson (`Walkthrough.goal`) — along the walk the tap-to-move would
 * take: through the doors that open on approach, up to the boss shutter. A
 * blind playtester spent minutes lost in look-alike rooms with only the
 * compass to go on; this says "this way" without a word, and quietly.
 *
 *  - Look: flat chevrons 4 cm over the floor, warm yellow at low opacity,
 *    with a slow wave of light running along them toward the target.
 *  - Where: 1.1 m apart from 1.5 m ahead of the player to 8 m out, fading in
 *    at the near end and out at the far one. They are spaced back from the
 *    TARGET, not from the player, so they stay put on the floor while the
 *    player walks and the next ones light up ahead.
 *  - When: only while the mission allows it (not in combat, under a modal,
 *    over a scene lesson or outside the play phase), there is a target
 *    that is not already in plain sight a few metres away, and a path to it.
 *    0.4 s fades either way; a switch to another target fades out first.
 *  - Cost: ONE instanced draw of at most six quads and one small shader, no
 *    per-frame allocation. A* runs at most every 0.35 s, and only once the
 *    player or the target has moved (or every 2 s standing still).
 *
 * The mesh hangs at the scene root: rooms are portal-culled per group, and a
 * trail crosses rooms.
