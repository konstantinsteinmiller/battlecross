 * ─── The reactivity firewall ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * throttled rate (≤ 15 Hz) for the parts of the HUD that are fine to update
 * through Vue (labels, objective text, button states), and it pushes transient
 * per-frame work (damage numbers, crosshair ring, joystick) to a ticker the
 * HUD component registers — those are direct DOM writes, never reactive.
