/**
 * ─── The climb at run time ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything that moves or can hurt on the tower (`world/climbGen.ts`), and
 * the player's body on its floor heights:
 *
 *  - Flux has feet now: gravity, ground snap down stairs and onto a lowering
 *    lift, a step-up of STEP_UP, a tenth of a second of grace over a pit edge
 *    (the shuttle's lip) — and no jump. Ladders are climbed by pushing toward
 *    the wall (away from it goes down), so forward climbs when facing the
 *    ladder and forward descends when coming off the top; the top steps off
 *    by itself. Slide lets go.
 *  - Lifts: a shuttle loops over a pit on the mission clock; a vertical lift
 *    waits at the bottom and rides up once stood on, then comes home — or,
 *    with `loop`, bobs up and down on the clock like a shuttle.
 *  - Crushers warn (a lamp, a click, a red ring on the walkway), slam, hold,
 *    rise. Under the head at the slam: a fifth of the health.
 *  - Scrap balls drop from hatches over the rolling stairs and roll down
 *    their lanes into the gutter, each lane's lamp going amber then red first.
 *  - Pits: a fall well below the last floor costs PIT_COST of the health and
 *    puts Flux back on the last checkpoint after a fade (MegaMan's pits,
 *    softened) — a visible pit holds spikes, twice that into lava
 *    (`Terrain.pitKind`, `pitKindOf`).
 *  - The dash leap: a slide that runs off a pit edge hops (LEAP_VY) and
 *    carries its momentum (LEAP_SPEED at most) with little air control, so
 *    a one-cell gap between equal floors is crossed and a two-cell one is
 *    not. Level designs rely on exactly that.
 *  - The platform stages' own mechanics (`sim/stageFeatures.ts`) are driven
 *    from here: their update, the walk they bend (`moveMod`), the body they
 *    carry, their snapshot. Secret alcoves stay walled off (a slab, blocked
 *    paths, the mesh's false wall) until `openSecret`.
 *
 * Nothing allocates per step: pools and fixed arrays built with the mission.
