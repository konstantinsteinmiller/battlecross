/**
 * ─── The fumble: a hard hit shakes Flux's charge loose ──────────────────────
 *
 * A machine lands a hard hit (a Core Master's blow, or one worth
 * `FUMBLE_HARD` of his bar) while Flux is charging the buster: now and then
 * (`FUMBLE_CHANCE`) he loses control of it.
 *
 * - The charge goes off at the level it had reached (a tiny one: a pellet),
 *   wild, in a wide cone round the view (`strayDir`). Never at the crosshair
 *   and never homing, but a normal shot after that: a lucky hit still counts.
 * - His arm flails for `FUMBLE_PANIC`, with no firing and no charging, and he
 *   blurts a line in a speech bubble (`flux.fumble.1..FUMBLE_LINES`,
 *   `FluxBubble.vue`).
 * - Sometimes (`FUMBLE_STUN_CHANCE`) the jolt stuns him for `FUMBLE_STUN`:
 *   no moving, no looking.
 * - Fire still held when the panic ends: the charge starts again from zero.
 *
 * A laugh, never a lock: at most one per `FUMBLE_COOLDOWN`. The mission
 * decides where it may happen at all: never in the tutorial (its Trooper
 * lesson needs a charge that lands), never in the exit cutscene, and never
 * from a trap, a pit or a blocked hit (`Mission.hitPlayer`).
