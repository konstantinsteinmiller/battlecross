/**
 * ─── The tutorial walkthrough: a lesson per room, a door per lesson ──────────
 *
 * "Wake-Up Call" is a guided walk along the main path, from the start pad to
 * the Scrapper's shutter. Every door on that path starts LOCKED (red lamp),
 * and a room's door out opens only once the player has DONE what the room
 * teaches — so nobody meets the boss, or the sectors after it, missing a
 * control or a mechanic the game takes for granted:
 *
 *   start  look and move (the coach, from the first frame), then the training
 *          drone: quick shots skip off its bubble, a charged shot pops it
 *   2nd    one Hardhat (shoot when it peeks), then a glowing crate that only
 *          a charged shot breaks
 *   3rd    one Shield Trooper: block its burst (a parry is welcome), a charge
 *          breaks its guard. Opens once it is down AND a block happened
 *   4th    one Stomper: slide out of its red ring. Opens once a slide happened
 *   5th    a chest: open it, and the boss shutter unlocks
 *
 * Then the REPAIR GEL, in the corridor out of the Stomper's room. Its door
 * opens as usual; halfway down the corridor a pressure plate clicks, a sheet
 * of fire fills the passage, and the door ahead slams shut. Flux is left on
 * exactly a quarter of his bar (never lower, never dead), with the room behind
 * him cleared and nothing awake near him. The gel lesson comes on (a gel is
 * granted, flying into its button, if he carries none), and the door opens
 * again once a gel is used. Its gate is the corridor, not a room, so it rides
 * beside the gates: `plan.gel`.
 *
 * No lesson can be skipped: a gate opens only once its steps are met, however
 * long that takes. A lesson skipped by accident brings in another teacher —
 * the Trooper down before a single block: a Rotor Drone rams (blockable); the
 * Stomper down before a slide: another Stomper — one at a time, the next a
 * beat (SETTLE) after the last one fell, for as long as it takes. A shorter
 * path folds lessons together (the chest joins the Stomper first); a longer
 * one gives its extra rooms a plain "clear it" gate. Walking into a held door
 * (or waiting at it) brings up "Finish the lesson", an arrow to `goal()` and
 * the glyph of what `needAt()` the door waits on (`sim/doorPrompt.ts`).
 *
 * Wordless like the rest: the coach's glyphs and the scene lessons do the
 * teaching; the walkthrough only schedules them and keeps the doors. A door
 * it opens gets a chime, a pulse and a yellow lamp (the mission's part).
 * `goal()` says where to walk next — each lesson's subject in turn, the door
 * it opens, the gel plate, the chest, then the boss shutter — and the floor
 * trail leads there once the coach's move glyph is learned (mission.ts).
 * Pure logic over a small host, pinned by `tests/game/walkthrough.test.ts`.
