/**
 * ─── Mission lessons: one mechanic at a time, taught by a SCENE ──────────────
 *
 * The coach (`coach.ts`) teaches INPUTS. Some mechanics need a situation
 * built for them instead, so a new player meets each one once, in a setting
 * where it is the obvious thing to do — and no word is ever shown:
 *
 * 1. CHARGE. In the tutorial's start room a training drone hovers in front
 *    of the pad inside an energy bubble. Quick shots skip off the bubble; a
 *    charged shot pops it. The glyph — a looping demo: a finger (or the left
 *    mouse button) held down, the crosshair's rings filling, the shot growing,
 *    let go and it flies in (`ChargeDemo.vue`) — comes onto the drone once
 *    the player can move and look — the coach's first two glyphs — or at
 *    once when a quick shot skips off, and stays until it pops. Letting go
 *    too early shakes it, like a quick shot does, after a replay of the try.
 * 2. CRATES. Supply crates only break to charged shots. In the second room
 *    the player enters, once its machines are down, one crate glows and
 *    carries the same glyph. A quick shot bounces off it.
 * 3. THE SPECIAL WEAPON. In the first mission with a copied weapon slotted,
 *    as soon as a room is clear three drones beam in, asleep, in a row at
 *    exactly the spread of the weapon. The glyph is the weapon's key (1) and
 *    three guide lines fan out to them; one press takes all three.
 * 4. THE REPAIR GEL. Hurt, a gel carried, nothing fighting: the gel button
 *    pulses and wears its key (H) or a tapping finger, and a small glyph
 *    pours the gel into a heart that fills green. Using one pops the check.
 *    In the tutorial the walkthrough brings it on after the gel corridor's
 *    trap; elsewhere a player who never learned it gets it at the first calm
 *    moment under half health.
 *
 * Only one lesson is live at a time. Each is finished for good (a flag in
 * the save), and one that is ignored — the drones shot down with the buster
 * three times — retires instead of nagging. In the tutorial the walkthrough
 * (`walkthrough.ts`, the `guided` director) schedules the drone and the
 * crate itself, one room each, whatever the flags say: a replayed tutorial
 * is taught again. There nothing retires: each lesson holds a door shut
 * until it is done.
