/**
 * ─── The held door's prompt: "Finish the lesson", and which way ──────────────
 *
 * A tutorial gate stays shut until its room's lesson is done (`walkthrough.ts`)
 * and a red lamp over the lintel does not say so: two blind testers stood at a
 * gate not knowing what it wanted. So when Flux walks into a held door (or
 * keeps pushing against it), shoots it, or waits within IDLE_RANGE of it for
 * IDLE_AFTER outside a fight, three things come up:
 *
 * - the label "Finish the lesson" (`walk.finishLesson`), red-accented, in the
 *   top third — the one line of text in the walk;
 * - a red arrow toward the lesson (`Walkthrough.goal`), turning live with the
 *   view: beside the label, or on the screen's edge while the lesson is
 *   behind (`promptArrow`);
 * - on the door itself, the glyph of the input its step needs (`doorInput`),
 *   pulsing on each bump, shot and wait.
 *
 * It holds PROMPT_HOLD after the last push, then fades; it comes on (and its
 * glyph pulses) at most once every PROMPT_GAP, and never over a fight, a
 * modal or the exit cutscene. The waiting trigger also calls the room's
 * teacher, CALL_DELAY later so the label and the arrow read first (the
 * mission wakes it: the fight that follows is the lesson). Pure: the
 * mission feeds a tick, the HUD (`DoorPrompt.vue`) reads the answer.
 * Allocation-free per step.
