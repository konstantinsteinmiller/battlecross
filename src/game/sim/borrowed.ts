/**
 * ─── Borrowed weapons: a Core Master's power, for one mission ────────────────
 *
 * In the TV show Mega Man took an android's skill for a while after a fight.
 * Here a mission can leave a capsule on a pedestal (`models/weaponCapsule.ts`):
 * walk into it and Flux carries one of the copied weapons — preferably one he
 * has NOT won yet, a taste of a Core Master still ahead — on a third button
 * (key 3) for a few shots:
 *
 *   - It fires through the real `WeaponSystem`, so it looks, hits, pierces,
 *     freezes and exploits a boss's weakness exactly like the won weapon, at
 *     the rank Flux has for it (rank 1 when he has never owned it).
 *   - It costs NO Weapon Energy. Every shot spends one charge instead
 *     (`LENT_SHOTS`, fewer for the costly verbs); at 0 it pops and is gone.
 *     Gale Guard's charge is the cast; hurling the leaves is part of it.
 *   - It never enters `profile.hero.weapons` or the slots and never outlives
 *     the mission. A resumed mission keeps the charges left and which
 *     capsules are taken (the mission snapshot, `save`/`restore`).
 *   - Kills with a weapon Flux does not own train nothing (the mission skips
 *     the weapon XP), so a borrowed power never ranks up a weapon that is
 *     not his yet. The fallback of lending one he owns trains it as usual:
 *     it is his weapon either way.
 *   - Another capsule of the SAME weapon tops the charges back up (a full
 *     slot walks past it and leaves it for later); a different weapon
 *     replaces the borrowed one. Placement lends one weapon per mission, so
 *     in practice a second capsule is a refill and never a trap that throws
 *     away charges the player was saving.
 *
 * Where: the climb's harder reward ledge (the crusher bridge's alcove, named
 * `kind: 'weapon'` by `world/climbGen.ts`) holds one as its prize; a regular
 * story or job map has a 35 % chance of one in a treasure room (else a side
 * room off the main path). Never in the tutorial.
 * All from the map seed on a stream of its own, so the map, its spawns and
 * every other seeded draw stay exactly as they were.
 *
 * The first time a profile takes one, a wordless teach: the button pulses
 * with its key (3) or a tapping finger until it is fired once
 * (`ActionButtons.vue`). It waits while a scene lesson is on, and keeps its
 * card off a fight; the pulse is on the button itself, so no survival glyph
 * is ever covered.
