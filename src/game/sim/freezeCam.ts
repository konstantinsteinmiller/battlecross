/**
 * ─── Freeze-frame shots ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A short moment where the WORLD stops and the camera shows something: the
 * kill-cam (a machine crumbling), a trap's hit on Flux (volt, flame, spikes,
 * ice), Atlas pulling Flux out of a pit, or a lesson's card (first person, no
 * camera move). While a shot runs:
 *
 *   • nothing simulates — no machine, shot, trap, lift or timer moves, and
 *     nobody takes damage (the mission skips its whole step);
 *   • the effects keep playing — particles, debris, a death's squash-pop —
 *     so the moment reads as a frozen instant with sparks still flying;
 *   • a third-person shot frames Flux whole (the exit's hero rig) from a
 *     spring-arm camera that never ends inside a wall (`placeCamera`).
 *
 * A skippable shot ends early on the second fresh press of anything (one
 * press could be a stray one — a player mid-fire when the shot cut in).
 *
 * The director is pure bookkeeping plus a camera solver, so tests pin its
 * rules without a scene.
