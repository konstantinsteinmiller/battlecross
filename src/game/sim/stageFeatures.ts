/**
 * ─── Stage features: the platform stages' mechanics, one file each ───────────
 *
 * The climb's own parts (lifts, crushers, scrap balls, ladders) live in
 * `sim/climb.ts`. Everything a platform stage adds on top — ice, wind
 * tunnels, flame vents, a rail cart, waves of flyers, secret walls — is a
 * `StageFeature` in a file of its own, built by `buildStageFeatures` from the
 * terrain's optional lists and driven by `ClimbRun`:
 *
 *  - `update` every step before the player moves (like the lifts);
 *  - `move` bends the walk where the player stands: `friction` multiplies the
 *    mission's velocity blend (ice < 1: momentum carries), `push` is added to
 *    this step's move (m/s: a gust);
 *  - `carry` takes the body over for a step (a rail cart), `locksMove` makes
 *    the stick idle meanwhile (looking and shooting still work);
 *  - `shotHits` lets a feature's solid things stop Flux's shots (an ice
 *    pillar, a cracked one shot down);
 *  - `shot` sees each player shot's step (a secret's wall buttons);
 *  - `save` / `restore` ride in the climb's snapshot, by the feature's place
 *    in the list — so the list's order is fixed, and a feature is built
 *    (possibly idle) whenever its terrain list exists.
 *
 * A feature allocates at build time only, never per step. Atlas speaks for
 * a feature through `ClimbHost.say` (`hint.<id>`, `secret.<id>` lines; see
 * `sim/atlas.ts`), most simply with an `AtlasCue` — no glyphs, no tutorial
 * overlays: a stage teaches by its layout and Atlas's one line.
