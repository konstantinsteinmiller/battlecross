/**
 * ─── The control coach: wordless, on-screen, earned away ─────────────────────
 *
 * Replaces the text tips. Every control is taught by a GLYPH drawn where the
 * action happens (a WASD cluster, a mouse with the right button lit, a finger
 * tracing an ∞ where the joystick works, a pulsing ring on the shield button…), never by a
 * sentence that disappears before it is read. Each glyph stays until the
 * player has actually DONE the thing a few times: every success flashes it
 * green and fills a pip, and the last one pops a check and retires it.
 *
 * Rules, each from a playtest:
 * - Nothing times out. A player who has not learned to look around still sees
 *   the look glyph a minute later; one who has, never sees it again.
 * - Mastery is per INPUT FAMILY (touch vs mouse+keys): a desktop veteran who
 *   picks up a phone has not learned the joystick.
 * - Some glyphs a family never gets (`UNTAUGHT`): on touch the ∞ finger
 *   teaches the drag, and the camera has no glyph of its own.
 * - It comes back when the player seems stuck — no camera movement for a
 *   while, not shooting in a fight, eating blockable hits — and the "?"
 *   button brings the core set back on demand.
 * - One input per glyph. "Shift or right-click" was read as Shift+right-click,
 *   which Firefox answers with its own context menu, uncancellably.
 * - A scene lesson (`lessons.ts`) quiets everything but survival — and the
 *   thumbs: moving and looking are never silenced, not even on the first
 *   frame with the training drone in view.
 *
 * Pure bookkeeping: the mission reports successes (`use`) and context, the HUD
 * reads `views()`.
