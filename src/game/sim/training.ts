/**
 * ─── Training: show, then train (the lesson rooms' running order) ────────────
 *
 * Playtests of the first mission: players walked past the training drone,
 * shot it with quick shots forever, never found the charged shot, never
 * blocked, never slid. Glyphs alone did not teach a MECHANIC. So every lesson
 * room now runs the same four beats:
 *
 *   intro  Atlas flies in with a gold bubble — "Let's train the Charge Shot" —
 *          while a gold vignette and the room's label ("Charge Shot Tutorial")
 *          say: this is a training room;
 *   card   time freezes and the view dims round the subject: a short card
 *          explains what the move is FOR (the one place in the game where the
 *          words matter). Never timed; any press continues;
 *   demo   the game plays it once through the real controls (`demo.ts`): Flux
 *          charges and pops a second drone while the button he would press
 *          lights up in sync — seen done, with the input that does it;
 *   try    the player's turn. The room's door opens once it is done
 *          (`walkthrough.ts`); stuck for HELP_AFTER, Atlas gives a hint, and
 *          again every HELP_AFTER.
 *
 * Done lessons tick off the checklist and are remembered per profile, so a
 * replay of the mission does not teach them twice. Pure bookkeeping over a
 * small host; `tests/game/training.test.ts` pins the order.
