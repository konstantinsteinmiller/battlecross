/**
 * ─── Waves of flyers on the rail (Rail Rush) ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A `WaveSpec` with trigger 'rail' is a run of Rotor Drones that beam in
 * while the cart crosses its room: the first wave a beat after the cart
 * enters, then one every `every` s, `total` in all, `count` at a time (one
 * fewer on a low-end device). They come in AHEAD of the cart along the rail,
 * off to alternate sides at the cart's height (`floor` on the rail, a
 * `hover` band round it, a `leash` round where they came in), swoop at Flux
 * as he passes (the drone's own attack) and zap at him on a rhythm of their
 * own — slow, blockable shots. The cart outruns them: one left far enough
 * behind it goes quietly. After the ride nothing new comes, and whoever is
 * still flying stays.
 *
 * Each new ride (after a restart on the boarding platform) runs the waves
 * again from the first; a finished ride keeps them spent.
