/**
 * ─── Voice-overs ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Atlas, Vex and Gauss speak lines (a speech bubble or caption first; a
 * recorded voice is an optional layer on top), and Flux barks when he is hit
 * (`barks.ts`, no bubble):
 *
 *   public/audio/voice/en/<line id>.ogg     English
 *   public/audio/voice/de/<line id>.ogg     German
 *
 * `<line id>` is the line's i18n key (`atlas.lowHp`, `story.atlas.goodMorning`
 * — voice-todo.md lists every one with its text). German players hear the
 * German files; every other language hears English — the bubble is always in
 * the player's language.
 *
 * It never fails loudly. The build lists the files that exist (see
 * `assets/overrides.ts`), so a missing line is never requested and never
 * logs a 404. A file that fails to fetch or decode is forgotten silently,
 * and that line stays a bubble. Nothing here throws.
 *
 * Voices play on the voice bus, under the same volume, mute, pause and ad
 * gates as every sound; an ad hard-stops one mid-line.
 *
 * Two channels: 'line' (one speaker at a time: a new line cuts the last, and
 * the music steps back) and 'bark' (Flux's yelps: never cut a line, never
 * duck the music, one at a time among themselves).
