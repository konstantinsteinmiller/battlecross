/**
 * ─── Enemy motion channels ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What makes a machine look alive between its attacks, as plain numbers: one
 * `EnemyMotion` per enemy, allocated once (`newMotion`), advanced by the sim
 * every tick (`stepMotion`, sim/enemies.ts) and read by the pose functions in
 * models/enemies.ts through their optional last argument.
 *
 * Three layers:
 *  - LOCOMOTION, measured: `walk` is how fast the body really moved this tick
 *    (not what the AI meant to do), and `stride` is the gait phase, advanced
 *    by DISTANCE (plus a shuffle while turning on the spot). A machine that
 *    stands still never plays its walk cycle, and a walking one never skates:
 *    the stance foot moves back by exactly the ground the body covers.
 *  - IDLE: `calm` (1 while unaware), a per-enemy `tempo` so a room never
 *    breathes in lockstep, glances (`look`) and random fidgets whose
 *    envelope starts and ends at exactly zero.
 *  - ATTACK channels eased at state edges (heli tilt, roller lean, brute
 *    punches): strikes follow their target, only the RETURNS are eased, so a
 *    telegraph reads exactly as before and nothing snaps back in one frame.
 *
 * Pure math and data (no three.js): unit-testable and allocation-free.
