/**
 * ─── Level catalog (DEV: the level lab, `/levels`) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Every kind of level the game can generate, each built by the game's OWN
 * quest builder (`tutorialQuest`, `storyQuest`, `rollJob`, `climbJob`), so a
 * level launched from the lab (`views/LevelLab.vue`) is the real level and not
 * a look-alike.
 *
 * A level type IS a quest template. The template alone decides the map
 * (`setupFromQuest`: the climb is `generateClimb`'s tower, every other one the
 * room labyrinth of `generateMap`, with a boss room for `boss` and
 * `tutorial`), the objective and the cast. The climb's sections are parts of
 * every tower (all seven, always in order), not separate levels. So the
 * catalog is keyed by `QuestTemplate`: a new template does not type-check
 * until it has an entry here, and from then on the lab lists it without
 * anyone touching the page. A new map generator is a new `MapKind`, which
 * does not type-check until `MAPS` can build it.
 *
 * Nothing here is imported by the game itself: the lab's route and the boot
 * hook in `flow.ts` both sit behind `import.meta.env.DEV`.
