/**
 * ─── Weak spots ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every machine and every Core Master has one weak spot: a small sphere on
 * its body. The androids' is the head; the other machines' is somewhere
 * their build leaves open — a rotor drone's tail, a stomper's back, a gear
 * roller's exhaust, a wall cannon's power core, a crate golem's back. A
 * shot that lands on it hits ×1.5 (`WEAK_SPOT_MUL`) with the amber "KRANCK!".
 *
 * It rewards AIM, never the aim assist: a shot only goes for a weak spot when
 * the crosshair itself is on it as it is fired (`weakSpotUnderRay`). A shot
 * the auto-aim or the lock-on steered — toward the body's middle — carries no
 * weak spot, so it can never land one, however close it passes.
 *
 * Offsets are in the machine's own frame, in metres at its normal size:
 * `up` from its feet (a flyer's hover height included), `fwd` along the way
 * it faces (negative = its back), `side` to its right. Elites are bigger
 * (×1.18), and the spot with them.
