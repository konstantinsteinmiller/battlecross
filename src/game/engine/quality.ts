/**
 * ─── Scenery quality ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * How much BACKDROP a device gets: the city round every mission
 * (`world/cityscape.ts`) and the intro's sets (`story/intro.ts`). Nothing the
 * player plays with changes with it — only how many far buildings, landmarks,
 * vehicles, raindrops and hologram towers there are to look at.
 *
 * `low` for a device that has already told us it is weak (`deviceClass`,
 * which reads the GPU's name, the RAM and the cores), and for a touch-first
 * phone with 4 GB or less, or 4 cores or fewer: budget phones, where fill,
 * vertices and the main thread are all short. Everything else gets `full`.
 *
 * `deviceProfile` itself only ever changes the canvas resolution (its own
 * rule); this is a separate, narrower knob for scenery, so it lives here.
 *
 * `?scenery=low|full` pins it (QA, screenshots, A/B arms).
