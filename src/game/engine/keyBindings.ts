/**
 * ─── Key bindings ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every keyboard action is bound to PHYSICAL keys (`KeyboardEvent.code`), so
 * the defaults sit under the same fingers on every layout: the WASD block is
 * ZQSD on AZERTY and ,AOE on Dvorak without any remapping, which is how most
 * PC games handle it. The player can rebind each action's main key in Options
 * → Controls; the other defaults (arrows, Numpad, the second slide key) stay
 * as alternates unless a rebinding takes them.
 *
 * What a key is CALLED on this keyboard is `keyLabels.ts`'s job.
 *
 * Escape (pause, and the browser's own pointer-lock exit), F1 / F2 and the
 * mouse buttons are not rebindable.
