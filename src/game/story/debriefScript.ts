/**
 * ─── The debrief: the story between two missions (#119) ──────────────────────
 *
 * After a Core Master's first fall, before the Lab: the city from above (the
 * intro's valley), and Pip — voiced now — tells it in short lines. What the
 * win changed, the weapon Flux copied, Vex's reaction on the Spire's screens,
 * then the next sector, its Master, what it has done there and how to beat
 * it. About 25 s, a tap moves on a line, Skip ends it.
 *
 * It is the game's main storytelling, so it must not drag: five Pip lines and
 * a goodbye, one Vex beat. Vex's beat is the Lab scene that Master already
 * had (`hubSceneFor`: his broadcast, or the blueprint, the reserve, the
 * breach), moved here so the story arrives in one piece; it counts as seen.
 *
 * Pure data: the mode (`story/debrief.ts`) plays it, `DebriefLayer.vue` shows
 * the cards. Lines are voice catalog keys = i18n keys:
 * `pip.debrief.<sector just freed>.<won|weapon|next|boss|tip>`.
