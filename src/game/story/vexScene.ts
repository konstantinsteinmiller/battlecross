/**
 * ─── Voiced story scenes: Dr. Vex on the screens (#117) ──────────────────────
 *
 * A scene is a short run of beats — a Vex line, an Atlas line, a sound, a
 * wait, a callback — on the caller's clock (the mission's or the hub's), so
 * a pause or an ad freezes it with the game. A line holds for its recording
 * (+0.4 s) or, with no file, for as long as its text takes to read; the next
 * beat waits for it. Vex's first line in a scene comes after his three-note
 * motif (`vexGlitch`), never baked into the files. A laugh (`vex.laugh.*`) can
 * close a line: its bubble stays up until the laugh ends.
 *
 * `sceneUi` is what `SceneBubble.vue` draws: who speaks, the i18n key and its
 * params (each param an i18n key, e.g. `{ boss: 'boss.blazeMaster' }`), and
 * where on screen.
 *
 * Every scene plays once ever (`profile.world.seen`, `vexSeen`): story beats
 * already seen never replay, New Game+ included (`startNewGamePlus`).
