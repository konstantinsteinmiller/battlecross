// ─── Gameplay-bracket fan-out ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One place that answers "is the player actually playing right now?" for every
// portal that wants to know. `GameScene.vue` reports the boolean; this module
// decides which SDK events that becomes, because WHICH events to send is a
// platform contract and not a view concern.
//
// ⚠️ PLAYGAMA is loaded the way every other call site loads it — a DYNAMIC
// import behind the env flag (`main.ts`, `FLogoProgress.vue`). It has no alias
// stub, so a static import here would pull its SDK loader into every other
// portal's bundle. That makes its two calls asynchronous, so they are chained
// on one promise: a handover's stop→start must reach the bridge in that order,
// and by the time anyone is playing the module is already in the registry from
// boot, so the chain resolves on the next microtask.
//
// ⚠️ POKI: the caller drives this from `watch(isLiveGameplay, …)`, and
// `isLiveGameplay` is a computed over five reactive inputs — so a modal closing
// in the same tick an ad opens emits a stop→start pair microseconds apart. On
// CrazyGames that is merely noisy. On Poki it is monetization-fatal: the core
// SDK counts a `gameplayStart()` landing within 50 ms of the preceding
// `gameplayStop()` as a "bad event", and at 10 of them `gameplayStart`,
// `gameplayStop` AND `commercialBreak` all become no-ops for the rest of the
// session, reported only through a debug log line. `pokiGameplayStart/Stop`
// collapse duplicate consecutive events and defer (never drop) a start that
// lands inside the guard window, which is what makes this call site safe.
//
// The import is STATIC on purpose: this file is not in the obfuscator's exclude
// list, so a dynamic `'@/…'` literal would be at the mercy of the `stringArray`
// rewrite. The PokiSDK URL is kept out of every other platform's bundle by the
// `resolve.alias` stub swap in `vite.config.ts`, not by the env-literal gate
// below — see `pokiPlugin.stub.ts` for why the gate alone is not enough.

// ─── What counts as live gameplay ───────────────────────────────────────────

// The RULE lives here, next to the platforms it is a contract with; the scene
// owns only the reactive wiring that feeds it. Pure and total, so the contract
// can be asserted without mounting a canvas.
//
// The phase is a plain string rather than the mission's own union type on
// purpose: that module is the whole simulation, and a platform-contract module
// must not drag it into anything that imports it.
