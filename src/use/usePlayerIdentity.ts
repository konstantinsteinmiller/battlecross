 * ─── Who the leaderboard row belongs to ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Two questions, answered independently because they fail differently:
 *
 *   WHO   — a stable id. Gets it wrong and the player collects duplicate rows,
 *           which is unfixable from the client and looks like the board eating
 *           their progress.
 *   WHAT  — a display name. Gets it wrong and a row is mislabelled, which is
 *           annoying and self-correcting.
 *
 * Neither ever prompts. A leaderboard that opens a text field before the player
 * has played is a leaderboard most players never appear on.
