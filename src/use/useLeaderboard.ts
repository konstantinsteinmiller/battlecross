/**
 * ─── The global board, client side ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * DECIDE WHAT `score` MEANS BEFORE YOU WRITE A LINE OF THIS, and write it here.
 * It is the one number the whole board is ordered by, and it must be MONOTONIC
 * — a lifetime best that only ever goes up (deepest stage reached, highest
 * level, longest survival), never a per-run total that can go down. The write
 * rule below ("only on a personal record") is built on that and quietly breaks
 * without it.
 *
 * `flair` is the second column: a number that is not what the board is ordered
 * by but tells two tied players apart (the biggest squad they assembled, the
 * furthest wave, the most kills). Rename both to whatever they are in this
 * game — the DB column names are arbitrary, the semantics are not.
 *
 * ONE RULE ABOVE ALL: NOTHING IN HERE MAY EVER THROW, BLOCK OR DELAY A RUN.
 * Every network call is wrapped, every failure is swallowed, every entry point
 * returns a resolved promise. The board is a decoration on a game that works
 * perfectly without it — a dead endpoint, a captive-portal wifi login page
 * answering 200 with HTML, a portal iframe with no network at all, all have to
 * end in "no rank shown" and nothing else. That is why `reportRun` is called
 * with `void` and never awaited at the call site.
 *
 * THE SECOND RULE IS THE QUOTA. This ships on Cloudflare's free tier against a
 * D1 database, and a client that posts at the end of every run would cost one
 * write per ~40 s of play per player. So: read the board at most once per page
 * load, and write ONLY when the player beat their own posted record. See
 * `reportRun`, which is the only function the game itself calls.

/**
 * ─── The estimate, and why there is no "#100+" ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * A PLAYER IS NEVER SHOWN "#100+". It is not a placing, it is the game
 * admitting it did not look — and it lands hardest on the players who need the
 * number most, because the hundredth published row sits far above where a first
 * session ever reaches. A best-effort number that is roughly right beats an
 * exact non-answer every time: nobody can tell #1130 from #1180, and everybody
 * can tell both from "past the end".
 *
 * WHEN THIS RUNS: only when there is no histogram ANYWHERE — not on the board
 * in hand, and no baked snapshot to borrow one from. Every rung above answers
 * exactly, and the snapshot ships with every build, so in practice this is the
 * legacy path: a cache banked by a build that predates the histogram, on a
 * device that has not fetched since. It is the floor of the design, not a
 * routine code path, and it is written to be plausible rather than clever.
 *
 * ── The model ──
 *
 * Two anchors are actually known:
 *
 *   • the last published row  → score `cut`,   rank `published`
 *   • the bottom of the board → score `FLOOR`, rank ≈ `total × FLOOR_SHARE`
 *
 * and rank grows roughly geometrically as the score falls, so interpolate
 * between them in LOG space, with `x = (cut − score) / (cut − FLOOR)`:
 *
 *   rank(score) = published × (floorRank / published) ^ (x ^ CURVE)
 *
 * Both constants earn their place; neither is a knob to fiddle with.
 *
 * `FLOOR_SHARE` — the bottom anchor is NOT `total`. The lowest score is a
 * single enormous tied bucket (everyone who bounced in the first minute), and
 * every one of them shares one rank. On the reference board that bucket is 721
 * of 2 422 players, so the worst placing anyone actually holds is #1702 — 70 %
 * of the total, not 100 %. Anchoring at `total` tells 721 people they came
 * last, which is both wrong and the most demoralising thing this feature could
 * say.
 *
 * `CURVE` — a straight line in log space between two anchors overshoots a
 * convex curve everywhere in the middle, and this curve is strongly convex:
 * ranks crawl just below the cut and then run away near the floor. Bending it
 * with `x ^ 1.5` takes the mean error on the reference board from 43 % to 10 %
 * and the worst from 82 % to 23 %. The basin is wide — anything from 1.4 to 1.8
 * lands within a few points — so this is a shape, not a fitted magic number.
 *
 * ── What it is worth ──
 *
 * On the board it was calibrated against (2 422 players, 100 published rows,
 * cut at score 13) it is within 23 % everywhere and 10 % on average, and it errs
 * mildly PESSIMISTIC by design: when an exact rank does arrive it is usually
 * better than the guess, and "you are higher than we thought" is the safe
 * direction to be wrong in. On a distribution with a very different shape —

 * The estimate this session already showed, pinned.

 * An estimate is a function of the BOARD as well as the score, and the board
 * moves underneath it — a `/score` reply carrying fresh rows, a refresh landing
 * mid-session. Recomputing would let one score answer #1130 on one screen and
 * #1190 on the next, which reads as the game guessing (it is) rather than as a
 * placing. So the first answer for a score is the answer for the session.
 *
 * The second clause is the one worth keeping: a player whose score improved may
 * never be shown a worse number than they were shown for a lower one. Within a
 * single board the curve guarantees that; across a board change it does not,
 * and "you cleared another stage, here is a worse rank" is the single most
 * broken thing this feature can say.
 *
 * In memory only, never localStorage: it is a guess made from a board that was
 * already stale, and the next session deserves a fresh one — most likely an
 * exact one, since any successful read retires this path entirely.
