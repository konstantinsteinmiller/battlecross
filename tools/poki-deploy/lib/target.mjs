// Which P4D game a run is allowed to touch.
//
// This repo was forked from another game, and its config still pointed at that
// game's P4D id for a while. Everything the pipeline does in P4D — reading the
// Versions list, uploading, ticking the Inspector checklist — is addressed by
// `gameId` alone, so a stale id does not fail: it uploads THIS build into THAT
// game, under a version name nobody there recognises. Nothing on the P4D side
// stops it.
//
// So the id is never guessed and never defaulted. A run that will reach P4D
// needs an explicit, well-formed id that is not one of the known foreign ones,
// and `deploy.mjs` checks that BEFORE it bumps the version, builds, or starts a
// browser. `--gates-only` never touches P4D and needs no id at all.
