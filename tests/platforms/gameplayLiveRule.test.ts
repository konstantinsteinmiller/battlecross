// What counts as LIVE GAMEPLAY — the predicate behind every portal's
// gameplayStart / gameplayStop bracket.
//
// This is a portal contract, not a view detail. CrazyGames counts the session
// between the two events; Poki measures conversion-to-play on the first
// `gameplayStart()` and takes a screen wake lock for the duration of the
// bracket. So every reason the game is not being played has to close it, and a
// missing one is invisible until a reviewer reads the SDK event log.
//
// The tab-away and portal-pause arms are here because they were once MISSING:
// both already halted the simulation via `isGamePaused`, so the game looked
// correct while the portal was never told, and a player who switched tabs
// mid-mission left an open bracket behind them.
