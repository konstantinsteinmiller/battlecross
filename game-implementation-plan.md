# Mega Droid — implementation plan

This is the resume point. Tick boxes as chunks land, and commit after every
chunk that is playable. Design lives in `GDD.md`.

## Starting point

The repo is a structure-donor copy of **survivalist**. We keep its
platform/infra layer untouched in behaviour:

- `src/platforms/*`, `src/utils/save/*` (SaveManager + strategies), ads
  providers, portal plugins, `useAds`, `useAdGate`, `useGamePause`,
  `useGamePauseAudio`, `useModalState`, `useGameplayLifecycle`, `useSaveStatus`,
  `useUser`, `useMatch`, `useHaptics`, the i18n loader and its 21 locales,
  `FModal`, `FButton`, `GameIcon`, `OptionsModal`, `SaveStatusBanner`,
  `AdsBlockedModal`, `FPerfMeter`, `usePerfProbe`, `perfVariants`, the build
  scripts and `vite.config.ts`.

Everything survivalist-specific goes: `src/game/*`, `useSurvival*`,
`components/game/*`, weapon/boss/shop organisms, the benches, the art-sheet
tooling routes, the survivalist tests (`tests/game`, `tests/sim`, most of
`tests/ui`), and the survivalist images.

## Persisted state

- One localStorage key: **`mega_droid_state`**
  (`src/use/useGameState.ts`, a rename of `useTowerState` with a new key and a
  new `ma_` field prefix). Save strategies, the merge policy and the CG
  scrubbing all reference `STATE_KEY` / the prefix, never a literal.
- Pre-rename keys (`mega_adventure_state` / `_board_cache` / `_uid` / `_name`)
  live only in `src/legacyKeys.ts`: each owner moves its key before the first
  read, and the cloud strategies re-file a pre-rename payload under the new
  name and never write the old one.
- Fields (`src/keys.ts`): `ma_hero`, `ma_inventory`, `ma_quests`, `ma_world`,
  `ma_stats`, `ma_mission` (the resumable mid-mission snapshot), `ma_tutorial`,
  plus the settings and identity keys.
- Merge score: `level × 1000 + storyStage × 5000 + questsDone × 40 + bolts / 100`.
- `src/game/state/profile.ts` holds a typed profile with `load()` / `save()` /
  `migrate()` over those fields. Gameplay mutates plain objects, and the store
  persists them at checkpoints (room cleared, loot taken, mission end, hub edits).

## Architecture

```
src/game/
  engine/     renderer.ts (three setup, DPR cap, resize), loop.ts (RAF + fixed 60 Hz step),
              input.ts (touch/mouse/keyboard → intents), camera.ts (FP camera, bob, shake, lock-on)
  models/     toon.ts (gradient ramp, outline hull, shared materials), kit.ts (rounded parts),
              hero.ts (Flux full rig + FP arm), enemies.ts (rigs per archetype), bosses.ts,
              props.ts (door, chest, crate, barrel, teleporter, pickups, data core, npc)
  world/      rng.ts, levelGen.ts (rooms/corridors/doors/roles), levelMesh.ts (merged static
              geometry per room), themes.ts, nav.ts (grid collision, LOS, A*)
  sim/        mission.ts (the whole in-mission world + update), player.ts, enemyAi.ts,
              bossAi.ts, projectiles.ts, pickups.ts, objectives.ts, damage.ts
  fx/         particles.ts (pooled additive sprites), rings.ts, beam.ts (teleport), flash.ts
  data/       enemies.ts, weapons.ts, skills.ts, items.ts, regions.ts, quests.ts, progression.ts
  state/      profile.ts (typed save), hudBus.ts (throttled reactive HUD mirror)
  audio/      synth.ts (chiptune SFX), music.ts (step sequencer, per-sector tracks)
src/views/GameScene.vue      canvas host, mode switch mission ↔ hub, modal orchestration
src/components/hud/*         Bars, Compass, Crosshair+ChargeRing, Joystick, ActionButtons,
                             DamageNumbers, Toasts, ObjectiveTracker, BossBar,
                             ControlHints + CoachRing + InputGlyph (the coach), ControlsPanel
src/components/hub/*         HubScreen, MissionsTab, HeroTab, CircuitsTab, WorkshopTab
src/components/modals/*      Pause, Results, LevelUp, Loot, Defeat
```

The hot path runs outside Vue. The sim mutates plain objects. The HUD reads
from `hudBus`, a shallow reactive mirror written at most 15 times a second,
while bars and damage numbers get direct DOM writes.

## Chunks (commit after each)

- [x] **0. Plan.** GDD.md + this file.
- [x] **1. Strip and scaffold.** Remove the survivalist game, add three.js,
  rename the state layer to `mega_droid_state`, add a `GameScene` with a
  renderer and a test room, and keep the splash/loader working. Typecheck and
  build green. *Commit.*
- [x] **2. Exploration.** Level generator + meshes + theme, FP controller
  (joystick, look, tap-to-move with A*), doors, collision, head-bob, the
  teleport beam-in, the Flux FP arm cannon. *Commit.*
- [x] **3. Combat.** Enemy rigs (hardhat, trooper, heli, hopper, roller, brute,
  turret), AI state machines, lock-on, quick and charged shots with the perfect
  window, block and parry, slide, telegraph rings, damage numbers, hit flash,
  death orb bursts, drops. *Commit.*
- [x] **4. Progression and persistence.** Profile store, XP and levels,
  attribute pick, the three circuit boards UI, Repair Tanks, the mid-mission
  snapshot and resume. *Commit.*
- [x] **5. Missions and hub.** Regions, story chain, job generator, objectives
  (kill, collect, rescue, elite, supply, purge), compass/tracker, beam-out,
  results screen, hub UI with sector map and job board. *Commit.*
- [x] **6. Loot and gear.** Item generation, chests with a loot burst, the
  inventory/Hero tab with a 3D paper doll, gear recolouring the rig, the
  Workshop (upgrade, salvage, tanks). *Commit.*
- [x] **7. Bosses and special weapons.** Scrapper, Blaze, Frost, Volt and Gale
  Masters, boss door, name card, boss bar, weapon unlock, weakness, weapon
  slots, arm tint. *Commit.*
- [x] **8. Audio and juice.** Chiptune SFX synth and music sequencer (routed
  through the existing pause/mute gates), hit-stop, screenshake, level-up
  flash, loot beams, tutorial tips (Pip). *Commit.*
- [x] **9. i18n and responsiveness.** Every string in en plus the 20 other
  locales, the i18n parity test, safe areas, portrait/landscape layouts, the
  320×658 check. *Commit.*
- [x] **10. Ads and lifecycle wiring.** Revive (rewarded), 2× bolts
  (rewarded), the interstitial before results, gameplayStart/Stop from the
  state machine, platform pause gating the loop. *Commit.*
- [x] **11. QA pass.** Typecheck, tests (sim unit tests, save round-trip,
  i18n parity), a production build, a headless-browser play-through
  screenshot run, and a perf check on a throttled CPU. *Commit.*
- [x] **12. Loader first.** The logo loader paints before any level work:
  the mission is built in 12 ms wall-clock slices, shaders compile in slices
  with readiness polling, the GPU warm-up renders a room at a time, and the
  scene adopts the boot mission instead of building a second one. The bar
  animates on the compositor and the stuck hint only shows on a real stall.
  `scripts/boot-timeline.mjs` measures it. *Commit.*
- [x] **13. Wordless controls coach.** Glyphs replace Pip's text tips (see
  GDD § Teaching the controls). This chunk also fixes the camera (look deltas
  were zeroed before the render applied them), makes a press that travels
  become a look drag instead of a charge, lets manual look win over the
  soft lock and hand it to the enemy in the sights, adds ← / → turning, the
  "?" button and the glyph panel in the pause menu. *Commit.*
- [x] **14. Global leaderboard.** Lifetime XP (new `stats.xpEarned`, floored for
  older saves) on the `leaderboard-badge` stack: the Worker deployed as
  `mega-adventure-leaderboard` with its own D1 and secret, a rank chip on the
  results screen, a top-100 modal from the hub, and a modelled histogram-only
  board for the builds that cannot post (Poki, Yandex, Playgama). *Commit.*

- [x] **15. Desktop controls, lessons and the upgrade tour** (playtest feedback).
  - Pointer lock on desktop (`engine/input.ts`): the first click captures the
    mouse, mouse movement looks, left button fires (hold = charge), right
    button blocks. Space = slide/dodge (Q kept silently, Ctrl dropped because
    Ctrl+W closes the tab), B = beam out, E = interact. Losing the lock (Esc)
    opens the pause menu; modals and the hub release it. Falls back to drag
    looking where the lock is refused. No soft-lock camera pull with a locked
    mouse; shots only snap to a machine near the crosshair.
  - Keycaps in front of every desktop prompt ("[E] Open", "[B] Beam out") and
    on the action buttons, labelled from the real keyboard layout.
  - Wordless mission lessons (`sim/lessons.ts` + `LessonLayer.vue`):
    charge shot on a shielded training target right after the first beam-in;
    supply crates break only to charged shots (lesson in the second room
    entered, once it is cleared); the special weapon (key 1) on a row of three
    sleeping drones in the first mission after the weapon is won.
  - Guided upgrade tour on the first hub visit (`HubLesson.vue`): Workshop tab
    → upgrade the buster → pick the chest armour → upgrade it → back to
    Missions. Everything else is dimmed and inert meanwhile.
  - Hero model and block barrier redesigned (`models/hero.ts`,
    `models/barrier.ts`; a subagent owns those two files).

- [ ] **16. Story: intro cutscene, story beats and the ending** (`story.md`;
  its § Decisions are settled). Builds on chunk 15 (the new hero rig, the
  upgrade tour, pointer lock). Every step lands its own strings in all 21
  locales (English first; keys and copy in `story.md` § New strings) and its
  own sounds (synth, plus a drop-in name in `sound-todo.md`), so the parity
  test stays green at every commit.
  - **Weakness ring and GDD** (small, independent, first). Turn the ring one
    step so each copied weapon is the key to the next Master: `weakTo` in
    `data/bosses.ts` becomes Blaze ← `galeGuard`, Frost ← `flameWave`,
    Volt ← `iceLance`, Gale ← `thunderArc`; `COUNTER` becomes fire ← wind,
    ice ← fire, volt ← ice, wind ← volt (fix the chain comment). A test pins
    that every Master after Blaze is weak to a weapon from an earlier
    sector. GDD: § Setting (five foremen plus VEX, the Red Signal, the beam
    network, Gauss in stasis, a link to `story.md`), the Core Masters
    table's *Weak to* column, § Feel (the first 10 seconds are gameplay for
    a player who skips the intro). *Commit.*
  - **Models**, each on the ModelLab turntable (`story.md` § Reused and new):
    - Prof. Gauss (`models/npc.ts`): console, lever, stagger, asleep, waking,
      a hand on a helmet, idle at the console.
    - The stasis capsule (`models/props.ts`): glass, a frost shell that grows
      and melts, a heartbeat light.
    - The valley diorama (new `models/diorama.ts`): six landmarks at the
      `regions.ts` `mapPos` spots, the relay ring, the Fortress shield with
      crack stages, a solid look and a hologram look.
    - Vex's hologram (the Mk-I faceplate, flickering), Flux's visor eye-lights
      (`models/hero.ts`), and the Masters' red "controlled" glow on eyes,
      chest core and crest, with a swap back to their own colours. *Commit.*
  - **Cutscene player** (new `src/game/story/`). `CutsceneMode` is a
    `GameMode` that plays a script of shots: a camera per orientation
    (framed the way `HubMode` frames Flux), pose tracks and timed events
    (SFX, music section, HUD boot, Pip's glyph bubbles, blinks, the
    screen-reader line). It runs on the sim clock, never on CSS animations
    or timers, so modals, ads, a hidden tab and a platform pause freeze it.
    `CutsceneLayer.vue`: the skip button (`skip-forward`, top right inside
    the safe area, from 0.5 s, `Esc` too, selector `.cutscene-skip`), Pip's
    bubbles projected from 3D, the eyelid bars, an `aria-live` line. No
    pointer lock while a cutscene runs (a click there only unlocks audio or
    skips); the gameplay bracket stays closed. *Commit.*
  - **The intro** (`story/intro.ts`, the six shots in `story.md`) — BUILT
    2026-09-28 to `story-arc.md` § 1 (cold open + five shots, 17 s): script
    `story/introScript.ts`, player `story/intro.ts`, layer
    `components/story/CutsceneLayer.vue`, models `gauss.ts`, `stasis.ts`,
    `diorama.ts`, `street.ts`; tests `tests/game/intro.test.ts`. Not yet: a
    dedicated three-section `intro` music track (it plays the hub theme with
    SFX stings, then the Scrapyard theme on the flash), and a 4× run of
    `boot-timeline`. The other bullets of this chunk are still open.
    - Save: `profile.world.seen: string[]` in `ma_world` lists the story
      beats already shown (`intro`, `relay:<sector>`, `vex:<boss>`,
      `blueprint`, `breach`, `ending`). `migrate()` marks every beat whose
      trigger is already behind the player, so an update never queues old
      cutscenes. Round-trip test.
    - `bootTarget()` picks the intro when there is no snapshot, the tutorial
      isn't done and `intro` isn't in `seen`, once the first-timer check has
      waited (capped) for the cloud read. Boot order: build the cutscene set
      (time-sliced), hide the loader (so `notifySplashGone` lets the
      GameMonetize / GameDistribution / GamePix first-load ad land before
      shot 1), build the tutorial behind the cutscene, and at the flash hand
      off to the tutorial's `beamIn`, or to `MissionLoading` until the build
      is done. A cloud save with progress that arrives mid-intro ends it.
      Ending or skipping adds `intro` to `seen`.
    - "Replay intro" in Options (hub only); a replay ends back in the hub.
    - `VITE_APP_INTRO` is on by default; `false` drops the intro from the
      build.
    - Strings `ui.skip`, `options.replayIntro`, `story.intro.*`. Sounds: the
      `intro` track in `music.ts` (valley in the hub's key, the Vex motif,
      the wake-up rise landing on the Scrapyard track) and the SFX `alarm`,
      `capsule`, `freeze`, `heartbeat`, `bootUp`.
    - Tooling that boots a fresh profile presses `.cutscene-skip` (the real
      user path, so the skip is exercised): `qa:xbrowser`, `qa:portal`,
      `perf:mission`, `perf-builds.mjs` stage 0, `tools/preview-video`. New
      marks `boot:intro-start` / `boot:intro-end`;
      `scripts/boot-timeline.mjs` reports when the tutorial build finished
      against shot 6 (14 s) at 4×. If it overruns, A/B the cutscene at
      30 fps during the build into `PERF-LEDGER.md`, don't assume.
    - Tests: first-timers only; ending and skipping both record it; a
      snapshot resume or a finished tutorial never shows it; a cloud save
      arriving mid-intro ends it; the cutscene clock freezes under
      `isGamePaused` and ads. *Commit.*
  - **Masters are freed** (`sim/bosses.ts`). After the orb-ring burst (now
    the red chip breaking) the Master kneels in its own colours for about
    1.5 s, then beams out. `mission.bossFreed` for the five Masters;
    `mission.bossDown` stays for the Mk-I (test). The ad-before-results
    order does not move (`tests/game/resultsAdOrder.test.ts`). *Commit.*
  - **Hub beats** (`sim/hub.ts`, `MissionsTab.vue`, `story/beats.ts`):
    - Gauss's capsule behind the pad, in frame in both orientations: asleep
      until the Mk-I falls, then Gauss is awake at the console.
    - The relay animation on the sector strip when a sector opens. The
      first one waits until the upgrade tour (`hubLesson.ts`) hands back to
      Missions.
    - Vex's skull flickers over a lab console on the first visit after each
      Master (about 2 s, angrier each time, `vexGlitch`).
    - The blueprint after the Cryo Plant (about 4 s, `story.blueprint`) and
      the Breach after the Sky Docks (about 6 s, `story.breach`), on the
      cutscene player with the menus slid away, before any other hub
      lesson. *Commit.*
  - **The ending** (`story/ending.ts`): four shots after the Mk-I's results
    close, short credits, then the hub; `ending` into `seen`, an ending cue,
    `story.ending.*`. No Mk-II sting: it ships with New Game+ (GDD § Core
    Masters), which has no chunk yet. *Commit.*
  - **QA pass.** Typecheck, all tests, a production build, `qa:xbrowser`.
    Every shot framed at 320×658 portrait and 764×385 landscape. `qa:portal`
    checks that the intro obeys mute at boot and the tab-away freeze, and
    that `gameplayStart` waits for the tutorial's play phase.
    `boot-timeline` at 4×. After release, compare conversion-to-play per
    portal and switch `VITE_APP_INTRO` off where it drops. *Commit.*

- [x] **16b. The city round every mission** (2026-09-28, not committed):
  `world/cityscape.ts` replaces the old fog-hidden skyline blobs. A far-future
  skyline (stepped, round, twisted, needle, twin and dome towers; landmarks:
  arcology, halo tower, leaning arch, floating district, sphere on a tripod,
  space-elevator tether, spaceport) and sky traffic (quadcopters, flying taxis,
  police cruisers with flashing light bars, cargo haulers, an ad blimp, a high
  freighter, rocket launches). Nothing flies over the level: every lane is
  ≥ 42 m outside its reach and ~26 m above its walls (tested). One shader
  (procedural windows, distance haze instead of scene fog), ~15 draw calls.
  Near/mid skyline builds behind the loader (time-sliced, longest chunk
  ~18 ms); the far band and landmarks stream in once play begins (3 ms a
  frame) and rise out of the haze; vehicles trickle in one every 0.3 s.
  `engine/quality.ts` (`?scenery=low|full`) gives budget phones ~40 % of the
  buildings, three landmarks and half the traffic; the intro uses the same
  tier (less rain, fewer puddles, half-size backdrop textures, half the
  diorama's towers) and streams its sets after the cold open's street.

- [x] **16c. The intro score, and Atlas** (2026-09-28, not committed):
  - "Wake-Up Call" (`audio/songs.ts`, id `intro`): 150 BPM so one 16th =
    0.1 s and every cutscene beat has a step; scored to the picture (hits on
    the charge shot, the Spire, the lever, the flash; silence on the freeze).
    Loops like the boss song (never rotates); joins mid-song at the cutscene's
    clock if the audio unlocks late (`setSongStartHint`). Loudness matched
    with tools/music-render.mjs: −18.6 LU per pass (Scrapyard −18.5), the
    cold open −17.1 (boss −17.0).
  - Atlas, Flux's AI companion: model `models/atlas.ts`; lines and rules
    `sim/atlas.ts` (briefings per mission/sector, story arc, boss ahead/freed,
    low health / weapon energy, traps, plates, objective, ride, level up,
    small talk; priorities, cooldowns, re-arming); in play it peeks into the
    top left of the view (viewmodel layer), in the beam-in / exit it flies at
    Flux's shoulder, in the intro it runs with him in the cold open and rises
    out of his chest disc at the wake-up. Bubble `AtlasBubble.vue`.
  - Voice-overs (`audio/voice.ts`): `public/audio/voice/<en|de>/<key>.ogg`,
    German for `de`, English for everyone else, listed at build time (never a
    404), silent on any failure. `pnpm voice:script` writes voice-todo.md.
    Loaded on demand: a line's file starts loading when the line is queued
    (`prefetchVoice`); a line still loading waits up to `VOICE_WAIT` (0.8 s),
    then goes up as a bubble alone.
- [x] **16d. Weak spots** (2026-09-28, not committed): `data/weakspots.ts` —
  one per machine and per boss (androids and the four Masters: the head;
  rotor drone: the tail; stomper, gear roller, crate golem, the Scrapper: the
  back; wall cannon: its rear core; Vex's Mk-I: the dome). Only a shot fired
  with the crosshair itself on the spot goes for it (`mission.aimShot` →
  `weakSpotUnderRay`, the camera's view ray, the side facing the eye, line of
  sight); an auto-aimed or locked-on shot carries no spot and never lands
  one. On the spot: ×1.5 (`WEAK_SPOT_MUL`), a crit, and the amber "KRANCK!"
  (`FloatingText.vue`: wobble, grow, snap away in 0.62 s). Placement checked
  in-game against every model, front and back.

- [x] **17. Blind-playtest fixes** (report: claude.ai/artifact/95ZdKQr6duPctCN7rMc4eH,
  2026-09-24). Done 2026-09-24, NOT committed: all six packages integrated,
  type-check and 729 tests green, round-2 report
  claude.ai/artifact/HLp2VHZ9c6G9nfiWpmNKMh. Round 2's open items (candidates
  for chunk 18): show each gate's requirement on its door and pulse it on
  contact; park the training drone in the doorway, with a stuck fallback; a
  hold cue on the block/parry cards and one safety drone instead of three;
  hit-direction arcs; dim the target frame behind walls; a dodge glyph for
  Slide (it hops back without stick input); a wider chest prompt; the level
  badge reads as a coin. Six parallel work packages with disjoint file
  ownership, then integration and a re-run of the same blind playtest:
  - **WP1 Guided walkthrough + coach** (`sim/coach.ts`, `sim/lessons.ts`,
    `sim/spawn.ts`, `sim/mission.ts`, `flow.ts`, `LessonLayer.vue`): move and
    look are never silenced by a lesson; the tutorial becomes a gated
    walkthrough along the start→boss path (look, move, fire + charge on the
    drone, Hardhat + crate, Shield Trooper block/parry, red-ring slide, chest,
    tank), each door opening when its room's lesson is done; scripted
    tutorial encounters (no Guardroid before the Scrapper); the lesson edge
    arrow only inside the lesson's room, drawn as the lesson glyph; the hub's
    Scrapyard card replays the tutorial until it is done.
  - **WP2 Glyphs** (`InputGlyph.vue`, `ControlHints.vue`, `CoachRing.vue`,
    `ControlsPanel.vue`): touch "move" is a finger tracing an ∞; the hold
    glyph reads without motion; the pause legend animates like the HUD.
  - **WP3 Objective trail** (new `fx/objectiveTrail.ts`, `sim/objectives.ts`
    `target()`): small subtle yellow floor chevrons along the nav path to the
    main objective, only once the walkthrough is done and out of combat.
  - **WP4 Bars** (`TargetFrame.vue`, `BossBar.vue`, `HudBars.vue`,
    `ScreenFx.vue`): MegaMan-style segmented enemy and boss bars; heart on
    the health bar, red pulse and edge vignette under 30 %.
  - **WP5a HUD text and glyphs** (icons, `TopStatus.vue`, hub/modals currency,
    `ObjectiveTracker.vue`, `GameScene.vue`, all locales): a nut glyph for
    Bolts (⚡ stays for energy/charge), "+140" reward chips, [Esc] on pause and
    F1 for help, the boss portrait on the objective card, "Defeat {boss}".
  - **WP5b Hub tour + pad beam** (`HubLesson.vue`, `hubLesson.ts`,
    `models/props.ts`): the tour's hand shows on the first frame and a tap on
    a dimmed control pulses the live step; the start pad's light column
    fades near the camera and after the beam-in.
  - Lead: wire WP3/WP5b into `mission.ts`, type-check, tests, build; harness
    fixes (emulated pointer lock so the host's real cursor is never captured,
    clicks at the crosshair while captured, an `aim` helper, short-exposure
    frames); re-run the two blind Sonnet playtests and publish a new report.
- **Chunk 18 — variety pass (2026-09-26).** Eight asks, built by parallel
  subagents with disjoint file ownership (at most three at once, targeted test
  files only, one full suite at the end by the lead):
  - **WP-A Hazards + Repair Gel lesson** (new `sim/traps.ts`,
    `models/traps.ts`; `sim/lessons.ts`, `sim/walkthrough.ts`, `sim/coach.ts`,
    `ActionButtons.vue`, `HudBars.vue`, `LessonLayer.vue`): 1–2 corridor traps
    per map (wall flame jets, a swinging blade), always readable, never
    stacked on a fight; in "Wake-Up Call" a scripted flame trap in a quiet
    corridor drops Flux to exactly 25 % with no machine near, then a wordless
    Repair Gel lesson (the gel button pulses, a gel→heart glyph, pips for how
    many gels are carried, the refill flows into the health bar). The gel
    button stays on screen whenever gels are carried, as a resource.
  - **WP-B Crate golem** (`models/enemies.ts`, `data/enemies.ts`,
    `sim/enemies.ts`, `sim/spawn.ts`, `data/regions.ts`): a machine that
    sleeps as a supply crate and takes no damage until a shot wakes it; it
    unfolds, lobs rocks, sidesteps charged shots it can see coming at range,
    so the answer is to close in.
  - **WP-D Climb mission** (new `world/climbGen.ts`; `world/nav.ts`,
    `world/levelMesh.ts`, `sim/mission.ts` player physics, `data/quests.ts`,
    `flow.ts`): a platforming stage with floor heights — stairs, drops,
    lifts, ladders, pits, timed obstacles — ending in a boss arena. Offered as
    the `climb` job template.
  - **WP-C Boss awareness + mute** (lead / later agent): HUD mute button left
    of "?" with F2; a mystery boss chip in the top row (the boss head behind a
    "?"); a yellow boss locator shown through walls for 5 s every 30 s until
    Flux is ~10 m from the boss door; a boss door that reads as danger.
  - **WP-E Temporary special shots**: capsules in the new levels grant a
    copied weapon with a limited shot count for that mission only.
  - **WP-F Level-up pick modal** (`LevelUpModal.vue`, `levelUpPick.ts`): pips
    per pending level-up, the badge shows the level being spent, a "+N" chip
    flies into a live stat readout, the cards re-deal after every pick, input
    locked 600 ms, a finish hold after the last pick; 1/2/3 keys.
  - Status (2026-09-27): WP-A, B, C, D, F built and screenshot-checked
    (boss door, chip, locator, gel trap + lesson on desktop and phone, climb
    rooms, level-up modal). Integration fixes by the lead: a sleeping golem
    never holds a lesson room or shows on the purge compass; the kill cheat
    wakes golems first. Open: WP-E (borrowed weapons) in progress; a real
    playthrough of a golem fight and a full climb on a phone; dedicated golem
    sounds (it reuses tink/door/stomp/lob); enemy AI/LOS is still 2D on climb
    platforms (leashed walkers slide along their leash edge).
  - QA harness for this chunk (scratchpad, not the repo): Vite dev server on a
    random port + playwright-core driving system Chrome with emulated pointer
    lock; click once to capture before expecting lesson cards (LessonLayer
    hides while `hud.pointerFree`); combat lock-on turns the camera onto any
    awake machine, so use `mission.debugCam` for prop shots.

- **Chunk 19+ — cybercity-story.md batch (2026-09-30).** One writer: only the
  main session edits code; subagents research and draft translations. Full
  decision table (D0–D53) in the published report
  https://claude.ai/artifact/UDq6P14LtaQcoDAyrJ9G34 and in
  `~/.claude/plans/steady-dancing-book.md`. Commit after every phase (P1…P10), then continue without waiting.
  - [x] **P1 Quick fixes and input** (commit 73c7642): right-click/back bug, middle-click block,
    boss gate opened by shoot/block, bubbles ×2 (non-voiced), chest + rail-cart
    shot collision, shield blocks mortars, freeze = 30 % slow (no stun), boss
    door stays shut + beam-out in the arena, weapon icon on results, supply drop
    reward/icon, mobile layout + buster glyph, first-touch controls modal,
    pointer lock after ads (+ playbook rule), shoot glyph on Gale, VO chains.
  - [x] **P2 Shared engines** (commit 3ddaa28; boss-room ideas 2–4 and the
    weapon-lesson room's respawns/spawn-on-move land with their levels in P4): FreezeCam, lesson framework v2, edge-leap,
    anti-stunlock + ranged fallback, hazards hurt enemies, spike pits + Atlas
    rescue, trap-hit cams + crumbling platforms, kill-cam + Gameplay tab + F4,
    flame cone + weapon VFX, chevron pulse, repair-kit model, boss-room kit +
    enrage, Vex-face door, wind turbine, puzzle validator, adaptive boss HP,
    Pip catch-up lesson.
  - [x] **P3 Mission 1 rework** + `fpv-tutorial` skill: "Wake-Up Call" is a
    built stage now (`world/stages/tutorial.ts`), lessons per room via
    `map.walkSteps`, a hidden first wall, the gap room, slide then gel then boss.
  - [x] **P4 Retrofit stages**: beam-in rooms (`Builder.beamRoom`, `map.beam`)
    teach the newest weapon behind a held door; spikes in every visible pit;
    Roller/Guardroid/golem/Hardhat on the first ground posts; 2–4 props per
    stage; per-Master arena hazards; health-reactive arena light; Gale hint
    readable. Deferred: crumbling slabs in the old stages (new levels only),
    the Scrapper's magnet crane.
  - [x] **P5 Intro showcase**: the cold open runs on 14.4 s at full speed
    after the release (`SHOW`; everything later is `old time + SHOW`, the
    score 144 steps later): the shot lands, a parry swats a diving drone,
    the shield takes a volley, a slide under the Trooper's shock ring, the
    finish, a Repair Gel; then the freeze and the rewind. Skyline rockets fly
    nose-first along their climb, with a thrust cone and a short see-through
    trail (none on the low tier).
  - [x] **P6 Balance pass 1**: `sim/balance.ts` plays the campaign on paper
    with the game's own tables for three profiles (reference: ×3 every 3rd
    mission, spends 60%; every-round ad; no ads); `scripts/balance-sim.mjs`
    prints it, `tests/game/balance.test.ts` pins the targets (Masters ~26–31 s,
    Vex ~50 s, machines 2–3 s throughout, never "behind", ad edge on bosses
    ≤ 6%). Tuning: the adaptive boss cap 2 → 3 (the Fortress let an
    every-round ad player run 38% ahead); `PROGRESS_HP` stays 0.06.
  - [x] **P7 Five new Masters** (Magnet, Drill, Tide, Neon, Rotor), one
    level per commit (P7.1 … P7.5), then the story docs (P7.6). Decisions:
    - Order and level bands (after Gale, before the Fortress): magnet [16, 22],
      drill [19, 25], tide [22, 28], neon [25, 31], rotor [28, 34]; fortress
      moves to [31, 40]. Existing saves: on load, unlock every sector whose
      `after` sector's Master is beaten (a Gale-beaten save gets Magnet).
    - Elements: the new Masters and sectors are `element: 'none'` (no new
      element in the counter chart); each has one `weakTo`. The new ring is a
      closed cycle: Magnet ← drillBomb, Drill ← bubbleLance, Tide ← neonBlade,
      Neon ← droneSwarm, Rotor ← magnetPull.
    - Weapons (cost / cooldown / dmg): magnetPull 3/0.8/×1.8 homing, breaks a
      guard like a level-2 charge; drillBomb 4/1.0/×2.8 lobbed, blasts r 2.5
      and breaks cracked walls; bubbleLance 3/0.7/×2.4 slow piercing bubble
      along the floor; neonBlade 3/0.6/×2.6 returning boomerang (hits going and
      coming, cuts enemy shots it passes); droneSwarm 6/1.8/×2.0 total, three
      homing mini-drones.
    - One new gimmick per level, as a stage feature (appended to the feature
      list: saves go by position), everything else reused:
      Magnet "Polarity Works" — magnet rails (floor strips that drag Flux;
      shoot a polarity panel to flip them), crumbles, leaps. Enemy Polar Pup
      (floating orb; its shell repels shots while blue, open while red).
      Drill "Deep Mine" — cracked walls (a level-2+ charge or a Drill Bomb
      breaks them: shortcuts, caches), falling rocks (the icicle feature),
      crumbling descents. Enemy Mole Driller (dust trail, surfaces, exposed).
      Tide "Tidewater Locks" — water (slows; the level rises and falls on the
      clock or a shot valve), bobbing pads (looping lifts). Enemy Puffer Mine
      (swells 1.5 s, bursts in a ring: pop it early or block).
      Neon "Blackout Boulevard" — light switches (shoot: lit bridges solid,
      dark ones gone), blackout pulses, the wall-kick shaft secret (D2: Space
      while facing the shaft wall kicks up a storey). Enemy Glow Stalker
      (only eyes in the dark; whine, lunge: parry).
      Rotor "Rotor Run" — the quadcopter ride (the rail feature on a flying
      path), drone hops (shuttles), gusts. Enemy Hornet Rotor (spin-up, dive).
    - Bosses reuse the World's attack parts (volley, lob, wave, ring, orb,
      leap, dash) per new pattern; phase 2 at 50% adds one pattern.
    - [x] P7.1 Magnet: Polarity Works stage (10 sections + arena + beam room),
      magnet rails + polarity panels (`sim/stages/magnet.ts`), Polar Pup,
      Magnet Master (magnetMissiles, polePull via `World.pull`, charge;
      polarStorm), Magnet Pull, chip theme, hub landmark, Atlas arc → 10
      relays, save migration for new sectors, all 21 locales.
      Interim until P7.5: the Fortress band rises with each new sector
      (now [19, 27], finally [31, 40]); the Magnet Master's `weakTo` is null
      until the Drill Bomb exists (P7.2 sets it, and `WEAK_TO`).
    - [x] P7.2 Drill: Deep Mine (11 sections + arena + beam room, 18 m down to
      0), boulders (plain walls; cracked ones break only to a level-2 charge
      or a Drill Bomb — the ice pillars on the drill theme), stalactites (the
      icicles on the drill theme), a two-cage mine elevator; Mole Driller
      (tunnels `buried`, bursts up on a red marker, out 1.8 s); Drill Master
      (burrow, drillBombs, charge; quake); Drill Bomb (bores on, bursts r 2.5,
      60% splash); Magnet weak to it now. Fortress interim band [22, 30].
      The Drill Master's `weakTo` waits for the Bubble Lance (P7.3).
    - [x] P7.3 Tide: Tidewater Locks (12 sections + arena + beam room, up
      with the tide to 14 m and down the spillway), water (`sim/stages/
      water.ts`: wading slows via `MoveMod.speed`, over DEEP it hurts on a
      tick; tide clock, valve-drained lock, currents), buoys; Puffer Mine
      (drifts, swells 1.5 s, bursts in a ring and is gone); Tide Master
      (dashSlash, tidalWave, bubbleVolley; whirlpool pull); Bubble Lance
      (a piercing bubble rolling along the floor); Drill weak to it. Fortress
      interim band [25, 33]. The Tide Master's `weakTo` waits for the Neon
      Blade (P7.4).
    - [x] P7.4 Neon: Blackout Boulevard (13 sections + arena + beam room,
      rooftops over open air), bridges of light (`sim/stages/neon.ts`: lit =
      floor; clock blink with a flicker, or two groups swapped by a shot
      switch), the wall-kick shaft (D2: a `kick` ladder — slide at its foot
      facing the wall, each slide kicks KICK_UP, he slips back between;
      Atlas's `hint.neon.kick` teaches it) up to the borrowed weapon; Glow
      Stalker (dark, eyes, whine, lunge, parry stops it); Neon Master
      (bladeBoomerang, dashSlash, neonVolley; laserGrid); Neon Blade (a
      boomerang that turns at BLADE_TURN and cuts again on the way back);
      Tide weak to it. Fortress interim band [28, 36]. The Neon Master's
      `weakTo` waits for the Drone Swarm (P7.5).
    - [x] P7.5 Rotor: Rotor Run (13 sections + arena + beam room, a sky
      airfield), the quadcopter flight (the rail ride on the rotor theme: no
      track, `buildQuadcopter`, its own lines; the course stays inside one
      open span), hornet waves, crosswind, shuttle and bobbing drones, a wind
      tunnel; Hornet Rotor (spin-up, straight dive, parry crashes it); Rotor
      Master (droneSwarm, downdraft — a negative pull —, dive; rotorStorm;
      weak to Magnet Pull); Drone Swarm (three homing drones); Neon weak to
      it. The Fortress's final band [31, 40]; the weakness ring is closed.
    - [x] P7.6 Story: Act IIb "The Second Shift" (Vex's reserve of five
      Masters, ten relays, the Breach after the Rotor Master; after Gale "the
      reserve" beat) across story-arc / story / comic (pages 25–29, R6) /
      story-voice-over / GDD; planned voice lines (scene `shift`) for Vex's
      intros and hub reactions and Atlas's sector and freed lines. Open: the
      Masters' tints vs the docs' freed colours, New Game+ has no level room
      past 40, the new ring pays off on rematches (only Rotor meets an owned
      weapon on a first run).
  - [x] **P8 Vex Fortress**: the Fortress is a stage now (17 sections +
    arena, three acts — Outer Wall, the Works, the Spire): Wardens (shell
    shut until they fire), sniper turrets on wall ledges, every Master's
    trick once more, a puzzle vault, two guard halls (`Terrain.guards`: the
    way out held until the hall's machines are down) with a checkpoint at
    each door — the Gatekeeper tank (front armour, open back reactor, chest
    hatch after a barrage) and the Twin Masters (Blaze and Frost echoes in
    their Masters' rigs, taking turns, the last one faster) — and Vex in the
    reactor hall, its fire, shock and gusts cycling on one clock. The Core
    Descent's roof-then-fall staging is not built (one arena; noted).
  - [x] **P9 Final balance**: the sim plays all ten Masters and the
    Fortress stage with its final bands. Reference player: Masters 26–34 s,
    the Gatekeeper ~21 s, each Twin Master ~11 s, Vex ~43 s; machines
    1.9–3.1 s throughout; never "behind"; the every-round ad player at most
    3% faster on a boss (35–40% on machines at the Magnet step, bounded by
    the upgrade cap). Pinned in `tests/game/balance.test.ts`. No constant
    needed changing after P6.
  - [x] **P10 Boot hot-path pass**: stage generators on demand
    (`stages/load.ts`, `stages/meta.ts`), shader error checks off in a build,
    hidden objects precompiled; PERF-LEDGER entry 6 (4×: long tasks 6.05 →
    5.85 s; the remaining 1.2 s intro hitch predates this work and needs a
    real-device check).

- **Chunk 20 — cybercity-story.md #100–#115 (2026-10-01).** Same one-writer
  method. Decisions (all defaults, accepted by the user) in
  https://claude.ai/artifact/AkWcZBqhx4iQopucLL5Pa9. #104–#107 were done before
  this chunk. Commit after every phase, then continue.
  - [x] **P0 #113 test cleanup** (b451b57): no /world, /characters or /water
    routes here; dead test out, predecessor fixtures re-keyed, Node test env
    by default (jsdom opt-in per file), full run ~43 s → ~30 s.
  - [x] **P1 #112 iOS resilience** (841344f): GL context-loss veil and
    recovery, gesture-armed audio resume for life, iPadOS = mobile, checklist
    taps, iOS low scenery + 1.5x (PERF-LEDGER 7, unmeasured).
  - [x] **P1b #114/#115 platform fit**: language read once (no Playgama poll),
    portal language never saved as the player's choice + explicit-choice flag,
    Options shows the live language, GamePix hint, Yandex retry + merge, F1 /
    Help opens the controls legend everywhere + frame focus. Open from the
    audit: Arabic RTL proof on the built Playgama archive (QA Tool, 320×658);
    CrazyGames keeps no device-local backup (CG forbids local data, by
    design); ad-before-results order per portal stays as pinned.
  - [x] **P2 #100 Overload shot** (giga re-timed: full + 3 s, 7x; Gale gate;
    bolt-priced epic-violet mod at 2300 bolts, outside chips and respec; Pip
    opens Circuits on it after the Gale Master).
  - [ ] **P3 Shared engines**: story-cutscene player, in-mission scenes,
    retry-from-checkpoint (Fortress), multi-room boss, multi-part boss +
    segmented bar + Atlas markers, drop hazards + movable crates, stage light
    pulse, baked Master portraits, audio mix engine (voice bus, ducking,
    variation, voice cap, SFX low-pass, limiter).
  - [ ] **P4 Retrofits**: 4.1 Scrapper crane (#108), 4.2 Neon blackout pulses
    (#110), 4.3 Deep Mine cart (#111).
  - [ ] **P5 #103 stage-select missions** (portrait grid, colour borders,
    boss splash in the load window).
  - [ ] **P6 #109 Core Descent** (roof → reactor hall → Core ring).
  - [ ] **P7 #101 Grand Master Bot** (7.1 rig + red-button assembly, 7.2 the
    four-part fight on the roof, Prism Cannon, checkpoint after Vex).
  - [ ] **P8 #102 outro + New Game+** (~2 min, skippable, credits, end card).
  - [ ] **P9 story/docs catch-up** (comic skipped).
  - [ ] **P10 final balance**; **P10b #114 sound pass**; **P11 boot/perf**.
  - Deferred: outro replay menu; checkpoint retry outside the Fortress; boot
    shader time-slicing until a real iPhone is timed.

## Resume notes

- Dev server: `pnpm dev` (port 2194 — 2050/2077/2193 belong to other games
  on this machine). Check the served `<title>` ("Mega Droid") before
  trusting a browser test.
- `#/models?m=hero&angle=20&zoom=2` — DEV turntable for every procedural
  model (`src/views/ModelLab.vue`).
- `window.__game.app.mode` is the live mission in dev (`debugCam` overrides
  the camera for inspection).
- Cheats: `localStorage.cheat = 'true'` (DevTools) + reload enables the hotkeys in
  `src/game/cheats.ts`, all on ctrl+shift+alt: B +1000 bolts, L level up,
  O finish objective, K destroy every machine, G god mode, U unlock all,
  J jump to the boss door (the corridor outside the shutter, facing it).
  Typing "cmarc" toggles debug mode (FPS/draw-call meter).
- Layout checks: 320×658 portrait and 764×385 landscape, touch UA. In
  portrait the top HUD row belongs to the bars and the status pills, so the
  compass, target frame and objective stack below it
  (`@media (max-aspect-ratio: 1/1)`). The results modal splits into two
  columns on short landscape screens.
- `<html lang>` follows the active locale (`main.ts`). Arabic gets
  `unicode-bidi: plaintext` on text blocks (`index.sass`), so sentences read
  RTL, while the HUD geometry stays LTR.
- Audio only starts once unlocked (`audioUnlocked` in `useAssets`: the first
  gesture, or a context that came up running because the embed grants
  autoplay). A track requested before that waits in `music.ts` and starts on
  the first gesture. The console stays free of autoplay warnings.
- Ads (playbook Phase 6): `finishMission` pays and saves, waits only on the ad
  GATE (another placement's ad, capped at 8 s), then reveals the results and
  plays the jingle. The interstitial runs on the result screen's Continue
  (`leaveResults`, won or failed): the screen closes first, the ad plays if
  pacing allows (121 s gap, none in the first 61 s after load; no 3-minute
  floor any more), and only then the hub opens and starts its music.
  `tests/game/resultsAdOrder.test.ts` pins that order. Every ad that
  interrupts live play or the hub restarts the music in `.finally()`
  (`resumeMusicAfterAd`): the revive, the supply drop and the QA trigger.
- Modals freeze the simulation (`isGamePaused`) but not the audio
  (`isAudioPaused` = ad / hidden tab / platform pause). The charge hum is
  silenced whenever the sim freezes.
- Gameplay bracket: `isGameplayLive` = a mission in phase `play` with no flow
  modal, modal, ad, hidden tab or platform pause (GameScene watches it).
- Rewarded placements: revive (once per mission), 2× bolts on results, and
  the Workshop supply drop (40 + 20·level bolts, 4-minute cooldown saved in
  `ma_stats.lastDropAt`). All are hidden unless `canOfferReward`.
- Hidden QA ad trigger: 20 taps on a bolts pill within 30 s
  (`useQaAdTrigger`). Ships in every build, the Poki and Playgama releases
  included; it is not dev tooling, so no alias strips it and no release gate
  refuses it.
- QA tooling (all run against a BUILT bundle; `npx vite build --outDir <dir>`):
  - `pnpm qa:xbrowser --dist <dir>`: Chrome / Edge / Firefox / WebKit play the
    first mission to the hub, with zero page errors.
  - `pnpm qa:portal --platform gamepix --dist <dir> --headless`: mute at boot,
    unmute, tab-away freeze and silence, resume, menu entry (12 checks).
  - `pnpm perf:mission --dist <dir> [--arms base,<flag> --reps 3]`:
    throttled perf with interleaved A/B. Results go in `PERF-LEDGER.md`.
- Drop-in assets: files in `public/audio/sfx|music` and
  `public/images/textures` replace the procedural sound or texture of the
  same name. They are listed at build time (`virtual:asset-overrides`), so a
  missing file never 404s. See `sound-todo.md` and `art-todo.md`.
- Portal culling (`Mission.updateRoomCulling`): rooms show through open,
  on-screen doors, two deep. Static props hang under their room group.
  Beam-in and beam-out, with the camera above the walls, show everything.
- Control coach: `game/sim/coach.ts` is the bookkeeping. The mission reports
  successes (`use`, `looked`, `moved`, `blockableHit`, `deflected`) and the
  context each step, and the HUD reads `hud.hints`. Progress is saved as
  `profile.tips['hint:<id>:<touch|mouse>']`. Clear `profile.tips` to see the
  first-run glyphs again. `tests/game/coach.test.ts` pins the rules. The
  playtest scripts drive a real mission: the first fight shows look and move,
  then fire and block (desktop cards under the crosshair; on touch, the tap
  glyph plus a ring on the shield button).
- Desktop mouse (chunk 15): pointer lock is owned by `engine/input.ts`
  (`requestPointerLock` / `releasePointerLock` / `isPointerLocked`), mouse
  BUTTONS come from mouse events (a second button while the first is held is
  a `pointermove` under Pointer Events), and a refusal only counts when the
  request rode a real gesture outside Chrome's re-capture cooldown.
  `GameScene` releases the capture for every pause reason and the hub, takes
  it back on Resume, and ignores an Esc that arrives with a lost capture.
  `hud.pointerFree` drives the click glyph on the crosshair.
- Scene lessons and the upgrade tour: flags `profile.tips['lesson:charge' |
  'lesson:crate' | 'lesson:weapon' | 'lesson:upgrade']` (plus
  `lesson:upgradeGrant` for the one-time bolt top-up). Clear them to see the
  lessons again. Pinned by `tests/game/lessons.test.ts`, `crates.test.ts`,
  `hubLesson.test.ts`, `input.test.ts`. Hub DOM anchors are `data-lesson`
  attributes (`tab-<id>`, `upgrade`, `armor`, `bolts`, `weapon-<n>`).
- Guided walkthrough (chunk 17): `sim/walkthrough.ts` locks the tutorial's
  start→boss path doors (red lamps) and opens each when its room's lesson is
  done; the tutorial seed is 20261916 (four path rooms), the cast is scripted
  in `spawn.ts`, progress rides the snapshot field `walk`, and the hub's
  Scrapyard card replays the tutorial until `tutorialDone`.
  `Mission.walkthroughActive()` gates the objective trail
  (`fx/objectiveTrail.ts`, `MissionObjects.target()`), which is also off in a
  fight and during a scene lesson.
- Browser defaults (menus, mouse/rocker gestures, autoscroll, history buttons,
  drag, selection, quick find, pinch) are cancelled in one place:
  `src/use/useBrowserGuard.ts` (capture phase on `window`, defaults only, text
  fields exempt; pinned by `tests/ui/browserGuard.test.ts`). Don't add
  per-component `contextmenu` blockers; extend the guard.
- Browser automation must NEVER take a real pointer lock: a headless Chrome on
  Windows captured the host's mouse cursor. Emulate it in the page (see
  `scripts/xbrowser.mjs`): override `requestPointerLock`, the
  `pointerLockElement` getter and `exitPointerLock`, and feed look as JS
  `mousemove` events with `movementX/Y`.
- Never put TypeScript in a pug template (`el as X`): the template is
  compiled apart from the script and is not stripped, so it is a syntax
  error in the browser that `vue-tsc` accepts. Cast in the script.
- A browser playtest that ends a mission on the dev server posts to the LIVE
  board. Route `/workers\.dev/` to a local answer in any such script (as
  `scripts/xbrowser.mjs` does).
- Input ownership: `consumeEdges` (end of each sim step) clears only EDGES.
  The look deltas belong to the render, which applies and zeroes them. Clearing
  them in the step lost every drag whenever a step ran between two frames.
- Boot timing: `node scripts/boot-timeline.mjs [url] [--throttle 4]` (or
  `--dist <dir>`) prints the `boot:*` User Timing marks and the long tasks
  until `boot:adopted`.
- Leaderboard (GDD § Global leaderboard): Worker in `worker/` (runbook
  `worker/SETUP.md`, account pinned in `wrangler.toml`). `.env` holds the live
  URL and the signing secret, so NOTHING automated may end a mission against
  it: vitest blanks both (`test.env`) and rejects non-local fetches
  (`tests/setup.network.ts`, pinned by `tests/game/noLiveLeaderboard.test.ts`),
  and `scripts/xbrowser.mjs` answers the Worker itself. A hand-run browser test
  that ends a mission posts a real row; delete it afterwards with
  `npx wrangler d1 execute mega-adventure-leaderboard --remote --command
  "DELETE FROM scores WHERE id = '<id>'; DELETE FROM board_cache"` (the id is
  `localStorage.mega_droid_uid`). `data/leaderboard-snapshot.json` (the live
  builds' offline fallback) appears on the first build after the board has
  players; commit it then. The modelled board is `pnpm leaderboard:seed`.
- Known open items for a human: the origin remote still points at the
  survivalist repo, and `.env` still holds survivalist's GameMonetize id and
  Glitch ids. Replace them before a portal upload. (The Playgama leaderboard
  id is cleared; create a Mega Droid board on the Playgama dashboard to
  switch that board on.)
